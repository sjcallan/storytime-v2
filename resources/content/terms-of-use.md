**TERMS OF USE**

**Last Updated: December 23, 2025**

**1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS**

Welcome to StorytimeBooks.ai (the "Service"), operated by Prescott & West LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.

**2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE**

StorytimeBooks.ai is an artificial intelligence-powered platform that generates stories and images based on user prompts. Users can specify plot elements, writing styles, and age-appropriate settings to create customized content. Our Service includes profile features designed to help tailor content to different age groups and reading levels.

**3. AGE REQUIREMENTS AND PARENTAL CONSENT**

You must be at least 13 years of age to create an account. If you are between 13 and 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), you may only use the Service with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian. Parents and guardians who create profiles for children are responsible for supervising their children's use of the Service and all content accessed through child profiles.

**4. AI-GENERATED CONTENT DISCLAIMER**

Our Service uses artificial intelligence to generate stories and images. You acknowledge and understand that:

AI-generated content is created by automated systems and may be unpredictable. While we implement content moderation and age-appropriate filtering systems, we cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that all generated content will be appropriate, accurate, safe, or free from errors. Generated content may occasionally include unexpected, inappropriate, or inaccurate material despite our filtering efforts.

Parents and guardians are responsible for reviewing content generated for or accessed by minors. We strongly recommend that adults preview AI-generated content before sharing it with children.

The Service is not a substitute for human judgment, and users should apply their own discretion when using generated content.

**5. CONTENT MODERATION**

We employ automated moderation systems designed to filter inappropriate content and maintain age-appropriate experiences across different profile settings. However, given the nature of AI technology, we cannot guarantee that our moderation will catch all potentially inappropriate content. Users should report any concerning content to us immediately at [contact email].

**6. USER ACCOUNTS AND PROFILES**

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. When creating profiles for children, you affirm that you are the parent or legal guardian of such children and consent to their use of the Service under your supervision.

**7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**

We retain all rights to the StorytimeBooks.ai platform, including our software, algorithms, and branding. Content generated through our Service is provided to you for your personal, non-commercial use. You retain any rights you may have in the prompts you provide. We do not claim ownership of the specific outputs generated for you, but we reserve the right to use anonymized data to improve our Service.

You may not use our Service to generate content for commercial purposes without a separate commercial license. You may not attempt to reverse engineer, copy, or replicate our AI systems or technology.

**8. PROHIBITED USES**

You agree not to use the Service to generate content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. You will not use the Service to create content that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others or that violates any applicable laws or regulations. You will not attempt to circumvent our content moderation systems or age-appropriate filters.

**9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PRESCOTT & WEST LLC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

**10. INDEMNIFICATION**

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Prescott & West LLC and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another party.

**11. PRIVACY**

Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand our data collection and use practices.

**12. MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICE AND TERMS**

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time without notice. We also reserve the right to update these Terms of Use at any time. We will notify users of material changes by posting the updated Terms with a new "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.

**13. TERMINATION**

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account and access to the Service at our sole discretion, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties, or for any other reason.

**14. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your State], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the Service shall be resolved in the courts located in [Your County/State].
